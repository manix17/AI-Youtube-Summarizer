## Permissions Explained 🔐

We value your privacy and only request the permissions necessary for the extension to function.

*   **`activeTab`**: Allows the extension to run only when you click its icon, limiting its access to the tab you're currently viewing.
*   **`scripting`**: Needed to inject the summary content into the YouTube video page.
*   **`storage`**: Used to securely save your API key and other settings locally on your browser.
*   **`host_permissions`**: Access to `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` is required to communicate with the Google AI API for generating summaries.

**Your privacy is our priority.** We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data. The extension communicates directly with the Google AI service using the API key you provide.
