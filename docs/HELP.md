## Getting Started üöÄ

### Quick Overview

This extension uses powerful AI models from **Google Gemini**, **OpenAI GPT**, and **Anthropic Claude** to read the transcript of a YouTube video and generate a high-quality, easy-to-read summary. This allows you to understand the key points of a video in a fraction of the time. You can choose your preferred AI provider and even create multiple profiles for different use cases.

### First-Time Setup (Crucial!)

## Understanding Your Summaries üß†

### What's in a Summary?

By default, the AI is instructed to provide:

- A one-sentence overview.
- 3-7 key bullet points.
- Actionable takeaways or steps.
- Notable mentions (tools, resources, people).
- Clickable timestamps.

### How the AI Determines Key Points

The AI analyzes the entire transcript, identifies recurring themes, important concepts, and the overall structure to create a condensed version that captures the core message. The quality is directly related to the quality of the video's transcript.

### Limitations of Automated Summarization

Remember, the summary is generated by an AI. It might misinterpret slang, sarcasm, or complex nuances. It's a powerful tool for understanding content quickly, but it's not a perfect replacement for watching the video when deep understanding is critical.

---

## Video Compatibility üé¨

- **Best Results:** Works best with videos that have clear, accurate, human-generated captions (often marked as "English" instead of "English (auto-generated)"). Educational content, tutorials, lectures, and talks are ideal.
- **Language Support:** The primary transcript-fetching method works for any language, but the default prompts are optimized for English summaries. You can customize the prompts for other languages.
- **Poor Audio:** If a video has poor audio, the auto-generated transcript will be inaccurate, leading to a poor summary.
- **Multiple Speakers:** The AI can usually handle interviews and podcasts, but it may not always attribute points to the correct speaker.

## Troubleshooting Guide üõ†Ô∏è

| Issue                                    | Checklist & Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Extension not appearing on YouTube**   | 1. Are you on a `youtube.com/watch?v=` page? It doesn't work on the homepage or channel pages. <br> 2. Try reloading the page. <br> 3. Check `chrome://extensions` to ensure the extension is enabled.                                                                                       |
| **"Summarize" button not working** | 1. **Have you set your API key?** This is the most common cause. Go to Options and set it up. <br> 2. Does the video have a transcript? Some videos disable them. <br> 3. Try switching AI providers in the profile dropdown. <br> 4. Open developer console (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+J) and look for error messages. |
| **Summary generation taking too long**   | 1. Very long videos (1+ hour) can take longer. <br> 2. The AI service might be experiencing high traffic. Try switching to a different AI provider (Gemini ‚Üí OpenAI ‚Üí Claude). <br> 3. Try a different model within the same provider.                                                                                                |
| **Poor quality or inaccurate summaries** | 1. Check the video's transcript quality. If it's full of errors, the summary will be too. <br> 2. Try different AI providers - each has strengths with different content types. <br> 3. Customize prompts in Options for better results. <br> 4. Create specific profiles for different video types.                                                                                                   |
| **Error: "API key not valid"**           | 1. Double-check that you copied the entire API key correctly. <br> 2. **Ensure the key matches your selected provider** (Gemini keys start with AIza, OpenAI with sk-, Claude with sk-ant-). <br> 3. Your key may have expired, been revoked, or lack permissions. <br> 4. Try testing the key in the Options page.                                                                       |
| **Storage quota exceeded error**          | 1. You've hit Chrome's storage limit. The extension will show a user-friendly message. <br> 2. Try deleting unused profiles in the Options page. <br> 3. Consider exporting/backing up important custom prompts before cleanup.                                                                                                                |
| **Error: "Could not find a transcript"** | This means the video likely has no captions or transcript available, or YouTube's page structure has changed in a way the extension can't handle.                                                                                                                                            |
| **Live Streams & Premieres**             | The extension cannot summarize live streams until they are finished and a transcript has been generated.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Performance and Limitations ‚è±Ô∏è

- **Processing Time:** Short videos (<10 min) usually take 5-10 seconds. Long videos (1+ hour) can take up to 30-45 seconds.
- **Usage Limits:** Your usage is limited by your own API key's limits with the respective provider (Google, OpenAI, etc.). The extension itself imposes no limits.
- **Internet Connection:** A stable internet connection is required to communicate with the AI services.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Designed for the latest version of Google Chrome.

---

## Privacy and Data Handling üîí

- **Data Access:** The extension only accesses the content of the YouTube tab you are actively trying to summarize. It does not read your browsing history.
- **Processing:** The video transcript is sent to the third-party AI service you configured (e.g., Google, OpenAI) to generate the summary. No video data is ever sent to our servers.
- **Data Retention:** Your API key and settings are stored locally and securely in your browser's `chrome.storage.sync` area. They are synced across your logged-in Chrome profiles but are not accessible to us.

---

## Tips for Best Results üí°

- **Use High-Quality Videos:** Videos with official, human-reviewed captions will always produce better summaries than those with auto-generated ones.
- **Customize Prompts:** For specific needs (e.g., summarizing a coding tutorial), edit the prompts in the Options to ask the AI to focus on code snippets, function names, and technical explanations.
- **Create Profiles:** Use the Profiles feature to save different prompt configurations. You could have one profile for educational content, another for podcasts, and a third for general use.

---

## Advanced Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Prompt Engineering:** The power of this extension lies in the prompts. Learn basic prompt engineering to control the AI's output. For example, you can ask for the summary in a different language, in a specific format (like a table), or from a certain point of view.
- **Model Selection:** Experiment with different models in the Options. Some models are faster, while others are more powerful (and may cost more per API call). Test your API key to see a list of available models.
