## Getting Started üöÄ

### Quick Overview

This extension uses powerful AI models (like Google's Gemini, OpenAI's GPT, and Anthropic's Claude) to read the transcript of a YouTube video and generate a high-quality, easy-to-read summary. This allows you to understand the key points of a video in a fraction of the time.

### First-Time Setup (Crucial!)

Before you can summarize, you need to provide your own API key.

1.  **Install the Extension:** Once installed from the Chrome Web Store, you'll see the AI YouTube Summarizer icon in your browser's toolbar. You may need to click the puzzle piece icon to "pin" it.
2.  **Open Options:** Right-click the extension icon and select **"Options"**.
    `[Screenshot: Right-click menu on the extension icon]`
3.  **Enter Your API Key:** In the Options page, select your desired AI Platform (e.g., Gemini) and paste your API key into the "API Key" field.
4.  **Test and Save:** Click the **"Test"** button to verify your key. If it's successful, models will load in the dropdown. Select a model and click **"Save Settings"**.
5.  You are now ready to summarize!

### Generating API Keys

Need help finding your API key? Refer to our detailed guide for step-by-step instructions for each platform.

**‚û°Ô∏è [How to Generate API Keys](./API_KEYS.md)**

### How to Know It's Working

- When you visit a YouTube video page (`youtube.com/watch?...`), a **"‚ú® Summarize Video"** button will appear below the video player and above the description.
- The extension popup will show a green light and the status "Ready to Summarize!".

## How to Use the Extension üìñ

1.  **Navigate to a Video:** Go to any YouTube video that you want to summarize.
2.  **Click the Button:** Click the **"‚ú® Summarize Video"** button located under the video player.
3.  **Wait for Generation:** The button will change to "‚è≥ Summarizing...". The extension is now fetching the transcript and sending it to the AI. This can take anywhere from 5 to 30 seconds depending on the video length and AI model.
4.  **View the Summary:** A summary box will appear directly below the button, displaying the AI-generated summary.
5.  **Copy Summary:** You can easily select the text within the summary box and copy it to your clipboard.

## Features Explanation ‚ú®

- **Multi-Platform AI:** Choose between Google Gemini, OpenAI, and Anthropic models to power your summaries.
- **Customizable Prompts:** In the Options page, you can edit the "System Prompt" and "User Prompt" to tailor the summary style and content to your exact needs.
- **Profile Management:** Create and switch between different profiles, each with its own platform, model, and prompt settings.
- **Dual Transcript Extraction:** The extension first tries a fast API method to get the transcript. If that fails (e.g., for videos without official captions), it automatically falls back to a slower but more robust method of reading the transcript directly from the page.
- **Interactive Timestamps:** Timestamps in the summary are clickable, allowing you to jump directly to that point in the video.

## Understanding Your Summaries üß†

### What's in a Summary?

By default, the AI is instructed to provide:

- A one-sentence overview.
- 3-7 key bullet points.
- Actionable takeaways or steps.
- Notable mentions (tools, resources, people).
- Clickable timestamps.

### How the AI Determines Key Points

The AI analyzes the entire transcript, identifies recurring themes, important concepts, and the overall structure to create a condensed version that captures the core message. The quality is directly related to the quality of the video's transcript.

### Limitations of Automated Summarization

Remember, the summary is generated by an AI. It might misinterpret slang, sarcasm, or complex nuances. It's a powerful tool for understanding content quickly, but it's not a perfect replacement for watching the video when deep understanding is critical.

---

## Video Compatibility üé¨

- **Best Results:** Works best with videos that have clear, accurate, human-generated captions (often marked as "English" instead of "English (auto-generated)"). Educational content, tutorials, lectures, and talks are ideal.
- **Language Support:** The primary transcript-fetching method works for any language, but the default prompts are optimized for English summaries. You can customize the prompts for other languages.
- **Poor Audio:** If a video has poor audio, the auto-generated transcript will be inaccurate, leading to a poor summary.
- **Multiple Speakers:** The AI can usually handle interviews and podcasts, but it may not always attribute points to the correct speaker.

## Troubleshooting Guide üõ†Ô∏è

| Issue                                    | Checklist & Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Extension not appearing on YouTube**   | 1. Are you on a `youtube.com/watch?v=` page? It doesn't work on the homepage or channel pages. <br> 2. Try reloading the page. <br> 3. Check `chrome://extensions` to ensure the extension is enabled.                                                                                       |
| **"Summarize Video" button not working** | 1. **Have you set your API key?** This is the most common cause. Go to Options and set it up. <br> 2. Does the video have a transcript? Some videos disable them. <br> 3. Open the browser's developer console (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+J) and look for red error messages when you click the button. |
| **Summary generation taking too long**   | 1. Very long videos (1+ hour) can take longer. <br> 2. The AI service (e.g., OpenAI) might be experiencing high traffic. Try again later or switch to a different AI platform in the Options.                                                                                                |
| **Poor quality or inaccurate summaries** | 1. Check the video's transcript quality. If it's full of errors, the summary will be too. <br> 2. Try customizing the prompts in the Options page to be more specific about what you want.                                                                                                   |
| **Error: "API key not valid"**           | 1. Double-check that you copied the entire API key correctly. <br> 2. Ensure the key is for the correct platform you selected (a Gemini key won't work for OpenAI). <br> 3. Your key may have expired or been revoked.                                                                       |
| **Error: "Could not find a transcript"** | This means the video likely has no captions or transcript available, or YouTube's page structure has changed in a way the extension can't handle.                                                                                                                                            |
| **Live Streams & Premieres**             | The extension cannot summarize live streams until they are finished and a transcript has been generated.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Performance and Limitations ‚è±Ô∏è

- **Processing Time:** Short videos (<10 min) usually take 5-10 seconds. Long videos (1+ hour) can take up to 30-45 seconds.
- **Usage Limits:** Your usage is limited by your own API key's limits with the respective provider (Google, OpenAI, etc.). The extension itself imposes no limits.
- **Internet Connection:** A stable internet connection is required to communicate with the AI services.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Designed for the latest version of Google Chrome.

---

## Privacy and Data Handling üîí

- **Data Access:** The extension only accesses the content of the YouTube tab you are actively trying to summarize. It does not read your browsing history.
- **Processing:** The video transcript is sent to the third-party AI service you configured (e.g., Google, OpenAI) to generate the summary. No video data is ever sent to our servers.
- **Data Retention:** Your API key and settings are stored locally and securely in your browser's `chrome.storage.sync` area. They are synced across your logged-in Chrome profiles but are not accessible to us.

---

## Tips for Best Results üí°

- **Use High-Quality Videos:** Videos with official, human-reviewed captions will always produce better summaries than those with auto-generated ones.
- **Customize Prompts:** For specific needs (e.g., summarizing a coding tutorial), edit the prompts in the Options to ask the AI to focus on code snippets, function names, and technical explanations.
- **Create Profiles:** Use the Profiles feature to save different prompt configurations. You could have one profile for educational content, another for podcasts, and a third for general use.

---

## Advanced Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Prompt Engineering:** The power of this extension lies in the prompts. Learn basic prompt engineering to control the AI's output. For example, you can ask for the summary in a different language, in a specific format (like a table), or from a certain point of view.
- **Model Selection:** Experiment with different models in the Options. Some models are faster, while others are more powerful (and may cost more per API call). Test your API key to see a list of available models.
