# Contributing to AI YouTube Summarizer

First off, thank you for considering contributing! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project and an overview of the development setup.

## Development Setup

This project uses `webpack` to bundle and build the extension. You'll need Node.js and npm installed.

### 1. Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:
```bash
git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
cd yt-summarize
npm install
```

### 2. Building the Extension
To build the extension for development, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will create a `build/` directory. This is the directory you should load as an "unpacked extension" in Chrome. The build will have source maps to make debugging easier.

For production releases, you can modify the `mode` in `webpack.config.js` to `'production'` to get minified and optimized code.

### 3. Loading in Chrome
1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable "Developer mode".
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `build` directory from this project.

### 4. Making Changes
After making changes to the files in the `src/` directory, you must run `npm run build` again. After the build completes, you can go to `chrome://extensions` and click the "Reload" button for the extension.

## Running Tests
This project uses Jest for testing. To run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```
Tests are located in the `tests/` directory. Please add tests for any new utility functions or modules you create.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains all the source code.
  - `background/`: Background script logic.
  - `content/`: Content script logic that runs on YouTube pages.
  - `popup/`: UI and logic for the extension's popup.
  - `options/`: UI and logic for the options page.
  - `utils/`: Shared utility modules (e.g., API handling, DOM parsing).
  - `assets/`: Static assets like CSS, images, and JSON files.
- `build/`: The compiled, ready-to-load extension code (generated by Webpack).
- `docs/`: Project documentation (`README.md`, `HELP.md`, etc.).
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests.
- `webpack.config.js`: Configuration for the build system.
- `manifest.json`: The core extension manifest file.

## Contribution Guidelines
- **Branching:** Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix (`git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`).
- **Coding Style:** Follow the existing coding style. We use Prettier for formatting (setup is a future TODO).
- **Commit Messages:** Write clear and concise commit messages.
- **Pull Requests:** Open a pull request with a clear description of the changes.

Thank you for your contributions!
